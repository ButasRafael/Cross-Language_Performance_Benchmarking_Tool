# Cross-Language_Performance_Benchmarking_Tool
This project provides a cross-language benchmarking tool to measure and compare execution times across languages (C, C++, Java). It evaluates memory management, threading, context switching, and migration times, presenting performance insights through a GUI. Ideal for researchers and developers analyzing language efficiency under similar workloads.
